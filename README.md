# Web-scraping with the use of Beautiful Soap

In this project, I have developed program that scrapes the quotes and authors name from web site: quotes.toscrape.com from all 
web pages (10 of them) and then puts them in csv file. For that I have use Beautiful Soap Python library for parsing structured data
since the web site serves static HTML content.

I will try to develop this project further, by obtaining the data about author and clean the data for possible futher use.
