# Web-scraping

In this project, I have developed program that scrapes the quotes and authors name from web site: quotes.toscrape.com from all 
web pages (10 of them) and then puts them in csv file. For that I have use Beautiful Soap Python library for parsing structured data
since the web site serves static HTML content.
After obraining the data, it should be cleand but I will do it later.
